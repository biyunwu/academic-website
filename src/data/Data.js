            `Forthcoming from Oxford University Press in August 2021.`,
            `This book, *Origins of Moral-Political Philosophy in Early China: Contestation of Humaneness, Justice, and Personal Freedom*, is a systematic presentation of the intellectual projects at the origins of moral-political philosophy in early China. The foundational period in Chinese philosophy, from the time of Confucius (551-479 BCE) to the establishment of the first unified imperial dynasty in 221 BCE, has always been considered the single most creative and vibrant chapter in Chinese intellectual history. Works attributed to Confucius, Mozi, Mencius, Laozi, Shang Yang, Shen Dao, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, Han Feizi and many others represent the origins of moral and political thought in China. As testimony to their enduring lure, in recent decades many Chinese intellectuals, and even leading politicians, have turned to those classics, especially Confucian texts, for alternative or complementary sources of moral authority and political legitimacy.`,
            `I make three key points in retelling this founding narrative of Chinese moral-political philosophy. First, the central intellectual challenge during the Chinese classical period was how to negotiate the relationships between the personal, the familial, and the political domains (sometimes also characterized as the relationship between the private and the public) when philosophers were reimagining and reconceptualizing a new sociopolitical order, due to the collapse of the old order. Consequently, philosophers offered a dazzling array of competing visions for that newly imagined order. Second, the competing visions can be characterized as a contestation between impartialist justice and partialist humaneness as the guiding norms of the newly imagined moral-political order, with the Confucians, the Mohists, the Laoists, and the so-called *fajia* (Legalist) thinkers being the major participants, constituting the mainstream intellectual project during this foundational period of Chinese philosophy. Third, Zhuangzi and the Zhuangists were the outliers of the mainstream moral-political debate during this period who rejected the very parameter of humaneness versus justice in the mainstream debate. Zhuangzi and the Zhuangists were a lone voice advocating personal freedom. For the Zhuangists, the mainstream debate was intellectually banal, morally misguided, and politically dangerous. All such efforts took place within the context of an evolving understanding of Heaven and its relationship with the humans.`,
            `This new narrative aims at offering an alternative paradigm to interpret the unique configuration of classical Chinese philosophical landscape and helping to chart a new course in understanding some of the motivating issues underlying the Chinese moral-political debate at its very inception. The book has incorporated scholarship on classical Chinese philosophy of the last several decades, providing a new overarching framework to recast the narrative of this formative period of Chinese philosophy. It is philosophically schematic and historically informed.`

First, his project of rehearsing the story of the origins of Chinese moral-political philosophy is located within a state-of-the-art account of the politics of the Western academy and the best efforts of its Sinologists and philosophers to make sense of the complex textual narrative of pre-Qin China in all of its parts. Again, appealing to a cluster of seminal themes—humaneness, justice, and personal freedom—he recounts the way in which different philosophical voices advocated for their own disparate and competing models of structuring and construing personal, familial, and political relations within the overarching context of what are fundamentally different valorizations of the notion of Heaven.”`,

        bookIntroduction: [
            `Are there Buddhist conceptions of the unconscious? If so, are they more Freudian, Jungian, or something else? If not, can Buddhist conceptions be reconciled with the Freudian, Jungian, or other models? These are some of the questions that have motivated modern scholarship to approach *ālayavijñāna*, the storehouse consciousness, formulated in Yogācāra Buddhism as a subliminal reservoir of tendencies, habits, and future possibilities.`,
            `Tao Jiang argues convincingly that such questions are inherently problematic because they frame their interpretations of the Buddhist notion largely in terms of responses to modern psychology. He proposes that, if we are to understand *ālayavijñāna* properly and compare it with the unconscious responsibly, we need to change the way the questions are posed so that *ālayavijñāna* and the unconscious can first be understood within their own contexts and then recontextualized within a dialogical setting. In so doing, certain paradigmatic assumptions embedded in the original frameworks of Buddhist and modern psychological theories are exposed. Jiang brings together Xuan Zang’s *ālayavijñāna* and Freud’s and Jung’s unconscious to focus on what the differences are in the thematic concerns of the three theories, why such differences exist in terms of their objectives, and how their methods of theorization contribute to these differences.`,
            `Contexts and Dialogue puts forth a fascinating, erudite, and carefully argued presentation of the subliminal mind. It proposes a new paradigm in comparative philosophy that examines the what, why, and how in navigating the similarities and differences of philosophical systems through contextualization and recontextualization.`

Jiang emphasizes that this discussion cannot take place at a shallow level, as very little new knowledge can be gained thereby. The point is made that we must learn to engage with different disciplines through what he calls ‘‘context and dialogue.’’ Overall, Jiang’s main argument for the importance of creating a new methodology for cross-disciplinary research in this way is presented very successfully.”`,

        bookIntroduction: [
            `Although Freud makes only occasional, brief references to China and Chinese culture in his works, for almost a hundred years many leading Chinese intellectuals have studied and appropriated various Freudian theories. However, whilst some features of Freud’s views have been warmly embraced from the start and appreciated for their various explanatory and therapeutic values, other aspects have been vigorously criticized as implausible or inapplicable to the Chinese context.`,
            `This book explores the history, reception, and use of Freud and his theories in China, and makes an original and substantial contribution to our understanding of the Chinese people and their culture as well as to our appreciation of western attempts to understand the people and culture of China. The essays are organised around three key areas of research. First, it examines the historical background concerning the China-Freud connection in the 20th century, before going on to use reconstructed Freudian theories in order to provide a modernist critique of Chinese culture. Finally, the book deploys traditional Chinese thought in order to challenge various aspects of the Freudian project. Both Freudianism’s universal appeal and its cultural particularity are in full display throughout the book. At the same time, the allure of Chinese cultural and literary expressions, both in terms of their commonality with other cultures and their distinctive characteristics, are also scrutinized.`,
            `This collection of essays will be welcomed by those interested in early modern and contemporary China, as well as the work and influence of Freud. It will also be of great interest to students and scholars of psychology, psychoanalysis, literature, philosophy, religion, and cultural studies more generally.`

        name: 'Tao Jiang',
        details: [
            `I am a scholar of classical Chinese philosophy, Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy, and cross-cultural philosophy. Currently, I am a professor in the [Department of Religion](http://religion.rutgers.edu/tao-jiang) and an associate member of the graduate faculty in the Department of Philosophy at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, US. `,
            `I grew up in the ancient city of [Chengdu](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/t-magazine/chengdu-china-travel-guide.html) in China’s southwest, “where the pace is slow, the food is spicy and there’s always time for a good gossip over a cup of tea.” As a boy, I often dreamt of an adventurous life in a faraway place, which probably explains why I came all the way to America to pursue my dream. Although America is far enough from China, an academic life devoted to philosophical inquiry does not sound like much of an adventure. Except it *is* an adventure: a genuine philosophical inquiry is an adventure of the mind in which that very inquisitive mind is its own limit. My approach to philosophy is to treat it as a way to study particular forms of intellectual and moral culture and the people who produce it.`,
            `I am the author of [*Contexts and Dialogue: Yogācāra Buddhism and Modern Psychology on the Subliminal Mind*](/buddhism_&_psychology) and the co-editor of [*The Reception and Rendition of Freud in China: China’s Freudian Slip*](/freud_in_china). My [articles](/papers) have appeared in leading Asian and comparative philosophy journals and several major anthologies. My new book, [*Origins of Moral-Political Philosophy in Early China*](/origins_of_chinese_phil), will be published by Oxford University Press in 2021. I have also been working on several other book projects, including a new interpretation of Linji's Chan/Zen Buddhist philosophy, Buddha Nature in medieval Chinese intellectual history, and a comparative project on free will. `,
            `I am Chair of the [Department of Religion](https://religion.rutgers.edu) and Director of the [Center for Chinese Studies](https://rccs.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University. I also co-direct the [Rutgers Workshop on Chinese Philosophy](/events) and co-chair the [Neo-Confucian Studies Seminar](https://universityseminars.columbia.edu/seminars/neo-confucian-studies/) at Columbia University. I am currently the co-chair of the [Buddhist Philosophy Unit](https://aar-conference.imis-inspire.com/a/page/ProgramUnits/buddhist-philosophy-unit) under the American Academy of Religion annual meeting.`,
            `I am married. We enjoy hanging out in coffee shops, museums, parks, and watching movies. We play tennis from time to time and love going to the US Open Tennis Championships. We support all effort dedicated to the saving of the world's wildlife. These amazing videos [“Hungry polar bear surprises a seal”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgnf6t9VEc), [“Elephant Calf Starves To Death Due To Drought”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqeC6XB94zs) from the [BBC Earth series](https://www.facebook.com/bbcearth) have opened up our eyes to the beauty, intelligence and misery of animal lives in the wilderness. Check them out, if you haven't, and your view about wildlife will never be the same again.`
